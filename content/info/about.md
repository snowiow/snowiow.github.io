Hi, my name is Marcel Patzwahl and this is my personal blog. Here I'm writing
about any technical topic I'm currently interested in. Most of the time this is
programming, DevOps, Linux, Vim or other terminal applications.

I hope you have as much fun reading as I have writing and working out the
different topics. I always try to write long in-depth articles which can be
followed as a step by step tutorial. If you have any questions or requests
feel free to write me an email. I will always try to answer as fast as possible.
