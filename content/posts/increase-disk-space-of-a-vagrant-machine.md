Lately I came across a rather big problem of vagrant: Increasing the disk
space, because the normal 40GB were in use. There are options to increase RAM
or CPU count easily. You can change it like this:

``` ruby
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = 4096
    vb.cpus = 4
end
```

So my thoughts were, that there must be a similar option to disk space as well,
but there wasn't. After some research I found out, there was no easy solution
to that. There are already some solutions though, but nothing worked for me
completely. I'm currently mainly using [kaorimatz ubuntu 16.04
iso.](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/kaorimatz/boxes/ubuntu-16.04-amd64) One point
which wasn't working for me is, that other machines used lvm2 as a volume
manager. Second problem was, that some people's new increased hdd's got
attached automagically to the vagrant machine, even though it should give an
UUID conflict. So I had to go for my own solution, which is a combination of
various solutions out there. I hope this is of any use for someone else out
there, who was as frustrated as I was.

# The Solution
First things first: This solution is for machines, which use
VirtualBox as their virtualisation platform. If you use VirtualBox, we can go
on. The first thing you have to do is turn your running vagrant machine off
(_vagrant halt_ or _vagrant suspend_). Next we need to find the actual VMDK
file, which represents the HDD of the machine. If you have installed VirtualBox
with the standard procedure, your machine should be here:

```
/home/<your username>/VirtualBox\ VMs/<name of the vm>/<name-of-the-disk>.vmdk
```

VMDK is a type, which can't be resized. So, after we switched into the
directory, the first thing we will do is converting it to VDI

```
VBoxManage clonehd <name-of-the-disk>.vmdk tmp-disk.vdi --format vdi
```

Now we are able to increase it

```
VBoxManage modifyhd tmp-disk.vdi --resize <size-in-MB>
```

As an example, if we want to have 60GB as the new size, the command would look
like this

```
VBoxManage modifyhd tmp-disk.vdi --resize 61440
```

Now we convert it back to VMDK

```
VBoxManage clonehd tmp-disk.vdi resized-disk.vmdk --format vmdk
```

The next thing we need to do, is closing the SATA controller to the old disk

```
VBoxManage storageattach <name-of-the-vm> --storagectl "IDE Controller" --port 0 --device 0 --medium none
```

Here are two things, you need to take care of. First thing is
_<name-of-the-vm>_. This is the same as the directory name, where the initial
VMDK file is placed. The second thing is, that your storagectl could have
another name. You can find it out by opening the _*.vbox_ file, which is in the
same directory as the initial VMDK file. This should be a normal XML file. Now
look out for this tag

``` xml
<StorageControllers>
  <StorageController name="IDE Controller" type="PIIX4" PortCount="2" useHostIOCache="true" Bootable="true">
    <AttachedDevice type="HardDisk" hotpluggable="false" port="0" device="0">
      <Image uuid="{42b28bc6-a130-45be-9603-ee16779459d5}"/>
    </AttachedDevice>
  </StorageController>
</StorageControllers>
```

As you can see, we are interested in the name of the _StorageController_ tag.
If there is something else than "IDE Controller", you need to use that name for
the _--storagectl_ flag instead. Now we need to close the old medium

```
VBoxManage closemedium disk <name-of-the-disk>.vmdk
```

When it is closed, we can attach our new resized VMDK

```
VBoxManage storageattach <name-of-the-vm> --storagectl "IDE Controller" --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium resized-disk.vmdk
```

Here you need to watch out for the same things, as in the last _storageattach_
command. Now you should be able to restart your vagrant machine (_vagrant
up_).  Afterwards SSH into it (_vagrant ssh_). Now you can check your disk
space with

```
df -h
```

If there is your new size already, you are done. But if you are like me and
still have the old size, we need to do some more steps. Namely we need to
create a partition with the new space and resize our filesystem to that space.
The following images are used from my example of increasing the disk from 40GB
to 60GB, but there shouldn't be a difference in doing the same for other sizes.
First we need to search for our HDD

```
sudo fdisk -l
```

There are some USB drives and the last entry should look like this

<img src="/images/fdisk.png" alt="Fdisk" title="Fdisk" />  

Here we are interested in what comes after _Disk_. This should always be
_/dev/sda_. If not, you continue using that name instead of _/dev/sda_. Next
execute

```
sudo fdisk /dev/sda
```

You should have entered the fdisk prompt now, which looks like this 

<img src="/images/fdisk-prompt.png" alt="Fdisk-Prompt" title="Fdisk Prompt" />  

Now type in __p__ and Enter to execute. This should call the current partition
table

<img src="/images/fdisk-partition-table-1.png" alt="Fdisk Partition Table" title="Fdisk Partition Table" />  

Here _/dev/sda1_ should be the boot partition, _/dev/sda2_ is the swap
partition and _/dev/sda3_ is the actual partition, which should be resized. If
yours isn't _/dev/sda3_, change the following commands to your partition name.
First we delete the current _/dev/sda3_ partition by typing in __d__ and Enter.
Now you should get to choose which one. We want to delete the 3. So we type in
3 + Enter.

<img src="/images/fdisk-delete-partition.png" alt="Fdisk delete partition" title="Fdisk delete partition" />  

Now we create a new one with __n__ + Enter. Next we choose __p__ for a primary
partition. The new partition number will be 3 again and the next two questions
for first and last sector will just be accepted with the default value by
pressing Enter. 

<img src="/images/fdisk-new-partition.png" alt="Fdisk new Partition" title="Fdisk new Partition" />  

As you can see we now have a new partition 3 with size 58.8 GB. To save the
changes, we have made so far, type in _w_ + Enter. This will result in an error
like this 

<img src="/images/fdisk-write-changes.png" alt="Fdisk write changes" title="Fdisk write changes" />  

As the messages tells us, the changes can't be applied until a restart. That's
why we do exactly that. We leave the machine via exit and execute:

```
vagrant reload
```

After a few moments you should be able to re-SSH into your vagrant machine. The
last thing we need to do is resize our file system to the new partition size.

```
sudo resize2fs /dev/sda3
```

If you do

```
df -h
```

again, you should now see the new size you've always wanted.
