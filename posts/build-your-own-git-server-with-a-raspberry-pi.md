In this post I want to go into a topic, which I did a few months ago. My goal
was to get some of my data away from big cloud hosting platforms back into my
own control. The initial spark was a news about a french artist, who had all
his pictures on googles platform blogger. His blog was deleted out of no reason
and his whole work was lost. You can read the whole story
[here](http://fusion.net/story/325231/google-deletes-dennis-cooper-blog/).
Scared of a similar scenario, I decided to setup my own cloud with seafile and
my own Git server. In this post I will cover how to put up a simple Git server
with a basic web fronted to view the repositories. I still use GitHub pretty
extensively but all my little and non private projects go onto my own Git
server now. First things first, we need some hardware to get started:

*   A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (older models should be sufficient too, but the newer the more performance you got at your hand)
*   5V Micro USB Plug
*   A Micro SD Card (the bigger, the better)
*   A Raspberry PI 3 Case
*   Another Computer to store an OS image on the SD Card (This guide shows the Linux way, but it should also be possible on Windows and OSX)
*   An ethernet cable to initially connect your Raspberry Pi to your router

I also bought an external hard drive where all my Git repositories and cloud
stuff is stored, but you can also buy a big SD-card and store the repositories
on it directly. In this guide I will go about the default SD Card way. If you
want to use an external hard drive, you need to format it to sda4 for example
and mount it to the point, where you want to have it. All your Git repository
directories should go there and the mount point will be your Git root.
Otherwise the procedure is the same as given in this guide.

One last thing on the notations in this post. Because we need to execute many
commands from the command line, I will use a short notion for which commands
have to be executed as which user. If a line starts with the __$__ sign, the
command is executable by a normal user. If you see a __#__ in the beginning,
you need to either execute the command with the _sudo_ utility or be logged in
as the root user.

# Installing the OS on the SD-Card
I decided to use Arch Linux ARM for the Raspberry Pi, but you are free to use
anything you want here. The reason why I chose Arch is because it's a very
minimal distribution. That said it only installs relevant software and from
there you are free to go. A warning up front: We will never get to see a GUI,
like in Raspbian or another Raspberry Pi distribution. On the plus side of
things is, you will have much more RAM and processor performance for the
software that really matters. My Raspberry Pi with Seafile and hosting the Git
site on an nginx server is using around 200Mb/1GB of RAM and about 2% of one of
the 4 processors on average. So there is plenty of stuff my Raspberry could do
as well, without getting overwhelmed. 

But let's get back to the installation: First tricky thing here is to use the
ARM7 Version. Even through the Raspberry Pi is listed as ARM8 I got huge
problems to get my wireless up and running. So go and get the Arch Linux ARM7
[here](http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-rpi-2-latest.tar.gz).
Afterwards you need to follow the installation instructions
[here](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/broadcom/raspberry-pi-2). 

# Configuring the OS
By now you should have installed Arch Linux ARM on the SD-Card, plugged it in
and you should be logged into your Raspberry Pi (Don't forget to connect your
Raspberry Pi to your router if you want to connect via SSH). There were still
some steps I needed to do to get started with my main project. Here is a short
list:

*   [Set your keyboard layout](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Set_the_keyboard_layout)
*   [Setup the wifi connection](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration#Manual_setup)
*   [Set your timezone, locale and hostname](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide#Time_zone)

# Setting up Git
Now we can get started with our real project. First we need to install Git:

```
# pacman -S git
```

Next we create a new Git user, who will be responsible for the repositories:

```
# adduser -m -g git -s /bin/bash git
```

The __-m__ flag says that we want to create a user directory in __/home__.
__-g__ is the default group of our user and __-s__ is the default shell of the
user. We need to be able to do stuff as the Git user, that's why he gets a
shell. That's it. Now you are basically ready to do Git stuff with your
Raspberry Pi.

# Create a new Git Repository
The next thing we want to do is create a new Git repository. Before we do
anything Git related, we want to suspend ourselves as the Git user, like this:

```
# su git
```

Now we are the Git user and can do stuff in his name. First we need a place,
where we want to place our repositories. A good place is the home directory of
the Git user, but it can be anywhere else, where the Git user has write access.
Now we create a new repository called _new-project_:

```
$ mkdir /home/git/new-project.git && cd /home/git/new-project.git && git init --bare
```

First we create a new directory with a _.git_ ending. You don't need the
ending, but it's a best practice, to let server side repositories end with
_.git_. Afterwards we go into that directory and initiate it as a Git
repository. The _bare_ argument is somewhat optional again, but also a best
practice. It just means this Git repository doesn't have a working directory.
The working directory is where you put your files. On the same level is a
_.git_ directory with the history and other things in it. The _bare_ argument
now says that you don't need the working directory and the main directory can
become the _.git_ directory. So overall you can remember to use the _bare_
argument on the server side of a repository and not on the client side.  #
Clone your repo Now we want to clone our newly created repository from the
server. You should already  know the ip of your Raspberry, when you've set it
up via ssh. If you don't know the IP yet, you can run the command ifconfig as
root, which should give you something like this as an output:

``` ini
#ifconfig
eth0: flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        ether b8:27:eb:8c:97:af  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)

        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 1004803  bytes 352750188 (336.4 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 1004803  bytes 352750188 (336.4 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

wlan0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.178.48  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.178.255
        inet6 fe80::ba27:ebff:fed9:c2fa  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether b8:27:eb:d9:c2:fa  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)

        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

As you can see in the output, I am connected via wifi. So the IP address of
interest is under _inet_ in the _wlan0_ block. If you are connected via cable,
there should be an _inet_ entry in the _eth0_ block. Now we know where to clone
the repository from like this:

```
$ git clone git@<your-inet-entry-here>:/home/git/new-project.git
```

In my case the command would look like this:

```
$ git clone git@192.168.178.48:/home/git/new-project.git
```

# Push your first change
Let's add a file with

```
$ touch test.txt
```

Now you should have some changes, which you can check with

```
$ git status
```

Now we do our first commit and add the test file to our commit.

```
$ git commit -a -m "added test file" && git push
```

Congratulations! You first commit has landed on the server. 

# Initiate an existing project as a Raspberry Git repository
We pretty much covered everything which you need to know to work with your new
Git server. But there is one last common use case, which I want to present to
you. What if you were already working on a project and want to sync it with the
server? First you have to switch into that directory and make it a Git
repository like this.

```
$ cd /path/to/existing-project && git init
```

Same thing on your Raspberry Pi. Create the directory with a _.git_ ending and
init it with the _bare_ argument (remember to do this as the Git user)

```
$ cd /home/git/existing-project.git && cd /home/git/existing-project.git && git init --bare
```

Afterwards your project files can be added to an initial commit like this (this
happens on your work station again)

```
$ git commit -a -m "my first commit"
```

So far there is nothing special. But now we add our Raspberry Pi as the remote server

```
$ git remote add origin git@<your-inet-entry-here>:/home/git/existing-project.git
```

Again in my case the command would look like this and you have to change it to
your case accordingly

```
$ git remote add origin git@192.16.178.48:/home/git/existing-project.git
```

Now you can push your fist changes and set the Raspberry Pi as the default origin like this

```
$ git push --set-upstream origin master
```

You are also able to name _origin_ anything you want. _Origin_ is just a
convention which is used for the default upstream. This was the main part,
which should get you up to speed with Git on a Raspberry Pi. In the next
chapter I want to show you, how to set up a simplistic Git web frontend to
watch your repositories, commits and diffs in the web browser. 

# Create a Website to view your repositories
The feature we are are using is the built in gitweb. It's a minimal web
frontend to view your code and you should already have seen sites like this
here and there. For example the project overview of my dotfiles repository
looks like this:

<img src="/images/gitweb_example.png" alt="Gitweb" title="Gitweb" />  

First of all we need a running webserver, to host our Git site. We are going
for nginx in this tutorial, but it's also possible to use
[apache](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/gitweb). To install nginx, we run

```
# pacman -S nginx-mainline
```

Afterwards we also need to install perl-cgi

```
# pacman -S perl-cgi
```

Now we start the nginx service via systemd

```
# systemctl start nginx
```

You can check if the nginx server is running by looking up the ip address of
your Raspberry Pi in your browser. In my case this would be navigating
to _192.168.178.48_. You should see a success message, that the nginx server is
running. Because gitweb comes preinstalled with Git, we can directly go into
activating the gitweb cgi script. Therefor we need to edit
the _/etc/nginx/nginx.conf_

``` default
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  localhost;

    #charset koi8-r;

    #access_log  logs/host.access.log  main;


    #error_page  404              /404.html;

    # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
    #
    error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
    location = /50x.html {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
    }

    location /gitweb.cgi {
            include fastcgi_params;
            gzip off;
            fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME  /usr/share/gitweb/gitweb.cgi;
            fastcgi_param   GITWEB_CONFIG  /etc/gitweb.conf;
            fastcgi_pass    unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.sock;
    }

    location / {
        root /usr/share/gitweb;
        index gitweb.cgi;
    }
    ...
}
```

As you can see in the code snippet, you need to add the gitweb.cgi location
into the server entity and tell nginx where to find the fastcgi_params and
pass. You also need to override the default location to be gitweb.cgi. All
changes you need to do, are highlighted in yellow. Now we need to install
fcgiwrap. This is a cgi server, which runs our gitweb cgi app.

```
# pacman -S fcgiwrap
```

Then we need to add a service config for fcgiwrap to be able to start it via
systemctl. Create the following
file _/usr/lib/systemd/system/fcgiwrap.service _with this content

``` ini
[Unit]
Description=Simple server for running CGI applications over FastCGI
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
Restart=on-abort
PIDFile=/var/run/fcgiwrap.pid
ExecStart=/usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -s /var/run/fcgiwrap.sock -P /var/run/fcgiwrap.pid -u http -g http -- /usr/sbin/fcgiwrap
ExecStop=/usr/bin/kill -15 $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Now we can enable and start the fcgiwrap server for nginx

```
# systemctl enable nginx fcgiwrap
# systemctl start nginx fcgiwrap
```

Hold with me, we are already done. The server is now able to run the gitweb cgi
app on the root directory of the nginx server. The last thing, we need to do is
giving gitweb the root directory, where it can find our repositories and set
the URL according to the Git IP, which we used earlier. To configure these
things we open up _/etc/gitweb.conf_ and set the content like this:

```
our $git_temp = "/tmp";

# The directories where your projects are. Must not end with a slash.
our $projectroot = "/home/git";

# Base URLs for links displayed in the web interface.
our @git_base_url_list = qw(git://192.168.178.48 http://git@192.168.178.48);

#Syntax Highlighting
$feature{'highlight'}{'default'} = [1];
```

The tmp folder can stay as it is. The project root is the home directory of our
Git user. You need to edit the Git URLs according to your Raspberry's IP
address, if it differs to mine. The last option enables highlighting of the
shown source code on the Git web site, which looks like this 

<img src="/images/gitweb-diff.png" alt="Gitweb Diff" title="Gitweb Diff" />  

A final restart is required for the changes to take effect

```
# systemctl restart nginx
```

Now you can navigate the IP of your Raspberry Pi again, like when you were
checking if the nginx server was running. You should now see your very own
gitweb frontend.
