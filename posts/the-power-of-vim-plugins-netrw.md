This time we look into an alternative for NERDTree, which is called netrw.
Thanks to [aguerosantiale](https://www.reddit.com/user/aguerosantiale), who put
my attention onto it. Both plugins serve the same purpose, but they behave
fundamentaly different in archiving this. So the first question you will
probably ask is: "why use netrw, if I'm already familiar with NERDTree?". The
biggest plus for netrw is, that you don't have to download anything. If you
_set nocampatible_ in your .vimrc you are able to use it. So if you are on a
different machine, for example connected via ssh, you are able to use netrw.
The second point is, that vim is very reactive by nature, but if you have too
many plugins running at the same time, you could destroy this attribute. So
it's always good to use something, what is already there. Not everyone will
like netrw, because it isn't the approach you know from Sublime Text or others.
Netrw is a so called split explorer, while tree views like NERDTree are called
project drawer. To learn about the difference, we will talk about the project
drawer approach first. Project drawer open a new split view on the
left(sometimes right) and stays opened during your complete coding session.
Every time you click on an item in the project drawer, it opens the files in a
separate buffer.

Vim wasn't supposed to work along with a feature like this. That's why we had
to do some tweaks in the [last
post](http://snow-dev.com/the-power-of-vim-plugins-nerdtree/), to make it work.
Especially if you are working with splits, you first must know in which split
NERDTree opens your file. If you got that down, you need to learn, how to
navigate between them fast. If you want to open a file in a split, which is on
the opposite to the project drawer, you have to go a long way... That's why we
created a keybinding to toggle NERDTree instantly. Then we choose a file and
got thrown in the opened buffer immediately. To sum it up: that aren't d many
key presses to get work done with NERDTree. So overall they provide a very good
solution for bringin in a principle, which wasn't supposed to be in vim
initially. But what is different with the split explorer? A split explorer
opens up in the same buffer. You then are able to choose a new file and this
file opens up in the same buffer again. It's like sitting in front of a book
and having the table of contents opened. You look up the page you want to see
and switch to the according page. If you read the page, you can go back to the
table of contents and choose a new page and switch to it and so on and so
forth. You are also able to open the explorer in another split view and choose
which file to open from there.

So what's the benefit from this? First of all: you look at the project
drawer very rarely(only if you want to change a file). So let's say 5% of your
time coding is spent with the project explorer and the rest of the time you
ignore it. But 95% of the time it is still open and takes away space from your
monitor. So why not keep it closed as long as you are working on a file until
you need to switch? Another benefit is, that you always know where your buffer
opens up. If you want to know more about project drawers and split explorers,
have a look at [oil and
vinegar](http://vimcasts.org/blog/2013/01/oil-and-vinegar-split-windows-and-project-drawer/),
it's great in-depth article about this topic. If you are a NERDTree user and
you are critical with the previous principle, you can test the split explorer
by adding the following line to your .vimrc

```
let NERDTreeHijackNetrw=1
```

Close your normal NERDTree with the _:NERDTreeToggle_ command and type in _:e
._ or create a mapping in your .vimrc. This is mine for example:

```
nnoremap <leader>e :e .<CR>
```

Of course you can take whatever binding you are comfortable with. Now NERDTree
should be opened in the buffer you are currently in and if you open a file,
NERDTree will hide and your chosen file appears instead. You can experiment
with this setup now. If you feel more comfortable with this setup, like me, you
can also do the switch to netrw. You need to learn some new shortcuts for
netrw, but they are pretty intuitive in my opinion. If you don't want to go
that way, you can stay with this NERDTree approach aswell and if you don't feel
comfortable with the split explorer approach at all you can keep using NERDTree
as it is. If you decided for netrw, I will get you going in the upcoming couple
of paragraphs.

## Configuration 
If you removed NERDTree and all the according configuration
from your .vimrc you can add the following line to your .vimrc.

```
let g:netrw_liststyle=3
```

This will open up netrw in tree like view and not a list. So it's easier to
recognize which are contents of which subfolders. You can now press the
shortcut defined above and you should see netrw. You are also able to open up
netrw in a vertical or horizontal split. I've created the following
keybindings:

```
"Open netrw in a vertical split
nnoremap <Leader>v :vs .<CR>
"Open netrw in a horizontal split
nnoremap <Leader>s :sp .<CR>
```

I use these, when I want to compare two files or look something up from another
file. The banner at the top is pretty helpful in the beginning, but it only
took away space when I knew all the information. At this point I added the
following to my .vimrc

```
let g:netrw_banner=0
```

This will hide the banner and only shows the tree itself. 

## Navigation
Like in NERDTree, you are able to navigate with the _j_ and _k_
keys. You can go to the top with _gg_ and to the bottom with _G_. You are also
able to search in the explorer buffer, to get to a specific entry fast(Those
options are also available in NERDTree, but I didn't mentioned them in the last
post). But jump up and down a directory(NERDTree: _p_ and _P_) don't exist from
what I've found out so far. Files and folders are opened by pressing
_<CR>_(Enter). 

## Bookmarking 
You are able to bookmark directories, but no files. By pressing
_mb_ you create a bookmark. With _qb_ you can open a quick fix window, which
shows the history and bookmarked directories, but you aren't able to choose
anything here. With _gb_ you should be able to jump to the last bookmark.
Bookmarking and everything project related, like changing the current work
directory and minimizing the tree to the current directory are the biggest
downside with netrw, because they often seem to not work properly or are
missing completely. 

## Opening files 
Like already mentioned, files can be opened by pressing
_<CR>_(Enter). Then they open up in the same view. You can also use _o_ to open
a file in a horizontal split or _v_ to open in a vertical split. Additionally
we've set shortcuts in the beginning to open up a split explorer in another
split. 

## Modifying Nodes in the file system 
In NERDTree we needed to call a menu
first and choose our operation afterwards, but in netrw there is a keybinding
for each of these operations, without the need to open a menu first. New files
can be created by pressing _%_. You need to type in the name afterwards and the
file will be opened automatically. By pressing _d_ you create a new directory.
_D_ deletes the current node under your cursor, whatever it is a directory or
file. The last operation in this bulk is renaming, which is called with _R_.
All operations will be done relative from your current cursor position. But
also this has a downside. Creating new files don't show up immediately.
Sometimes even a refresh didn't help(_C-l_). So I had to close the sub
directory and open it again, until it showed up. 

## Summary
I really like the split explorer approach, but for me netrw shows his
weaknesses, if I want to do anything advanced. I think netrw is the perfect
choice, if you only rely on navigation and opening files. If you want to do
more, netrw falters. NERDTree also isn't perfect to use with this approach,
because every time it is opened, it is reset. This means that every opened
directory is closed. So you have to navigate the whole way to a file again.
Thats why NERDTree is only a good choice, if you want to stay with the project
drawer approach. If you decided to stay with netrw and need further help, you
can type in

```
:h netrw
```

This will show you the whole documentation of netrw, containing all it's
features and configuration possibilities. During the writing of this article I
also am experimenting with vimfiler, which seems to combine the good things of
both plugins and adds a whole bunch of configuration possibilities on top of
it. I will probably cover this plugin in a later post, if it fulfills my needs.
