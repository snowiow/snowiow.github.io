Slowly but surely we get to the end of this series. In this last post, I will
write about database access from the host system, while your database is
running on the guest machine. Therefore I will present two strategies to do so.
Sure you also can

```
vagrant ssh
```

via the terminal and access the database on the CLI. But viewing and fast
editing of some tables is much more comfortable from a GUI. In this post I will
go over two MySQL applications: MySQL Workbench and PHPMyAdmin. While the
Workbench will be installed on your host system and access the database via
ssh, PHPMyAdmin will be installed on the guest system, on the existing apache
web server. Here we are able to access it over the hosts browser like our web
app.

# MySQL Workbench
The MySQL Workbench can be installed via your package manager
or from their [website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/). After the
installation we start up the vagrant machine and open the workbench. You should
see this area.

Click on the "+" next to the MySQL Connections. Now a new dialog should open up.

<img src="/images/workbench2.png" alt="Workbench 2" title="Workbench 2" />  

Choose "Standard TCP/IP over SSH". Afterwards fill out SSH Hostname and SSH
username, like I did. At the top you can choose whatever name you like for the
Connection Name. Then press Ok. Afterwards you should see your newly created
Connection.

Double-Click it and you will be asked for the SSH password. Since we didn't
changed it yet, it's still _vagrant_. Then you will be asked for the database
password. If you followed this tutorial closely, this will be __my_pw__.
Afterwards you should be logged into your database successfully and you can
start interacting with it. 

# PHPMyAdmin
Here we process similar, like we did in the earlier posts. First
we create a new shell script inside of our __sh__ directory. We start off with
the following content

``` bash
debconf-set-selections <<< "phpmyadmin phpmyadmin/reconfigure-webserver multiselect apache2"
debconf-set-selections <<< "phpmyadmin phpmyadmin/dbconfig-install boolean true"
debconf-set-selections <<< "phpmyadmin phpmyadmin/mysql/admin-pass password my_pw" 
debconf-set-selections <<< "phpmyadmin phpmyadmin/mysql/app-pass password my_pw"
debconf-set-selections <<< "phpmyadmin phpmyadmin/app-password-confirm password my_pw"
```

This should look similar to you. We already did it, while installing MySQL.
Because PHPMyAdmin is working with an interactive prompt as well, we pass the
different parameters in before. Out of simplicity we go with _my_pw_ as our
password again. Now we can install it

``` bash
apt-get install -y phpmyadmin
php5enmod mcrypt
```

On PHP5 we need to enable the mcrypt library, otherwise we get an annoying red
box inside of our PHPMyAdmin Frontend. The last part of our config looks like
this.

``` bash
if [ -f /vagrant/tmp/phpmyadmin.conf ]; then
    mv /vagrant/tmp/phpmyadmin.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/phpmyadmin.conf
    a2ensite phpmyadmin.conf
else
    >&2 echo "Error: phpmyadmin.conf not found"
fi

service apache2 restart
```

We put a virtual host configuration for the PHPMyAdmin page into the right
place, like we did with our web app in the last post. Finally we restart the
apache server. Our _phpmyadmin.conf_ looks like this

``` apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.com
    DocumentRoot "/usr/share/phpmyadmin"
    ServerName phpmyadmin.dev
    ServerAlias www.phpmyadmin.dev
    ErrorLog "/var/log/apache2/phpmyadmin.dev-error_log"
    CustomLog "/var/log/apache2/phpmyadmin.dev-access_log" common
    <Directory "/usr/share/phpmyadmin">
       Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes MultiViews
       Order allow,deny
       Allow from all
       AllowOverride All
   </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

This is almost the same, like we did in the last post, except for the new
paths. Additionally we set some more directory options for PHPMyAdmin to make
it's routing possible. Next thing to do is add these scripts as partitioners to
our Vagrantfile.

``` ruby
config.vm.provision "shell", path: "sh/phpmyadmin.sh"
config.vm.provision "file", source: "conf/phpmyadmin.conf", destination: "/vagrant/tmp/phpmyadmin.conf"
```

Now we are only missing an entry in our hosts file, to make the new domain
address known to our host machine. So we go to our _hosts_ file again and add
the following line

``` ini
192.168.33.10 	phpmyadmin.dev
```

That's it! Recreate or re-provision your vagrant machine and go to
_phpmyadmin.dev_ on your hosts web browser. You should see this page 

<img src="/images/phpmyadmin.png" alt="PHPMyAdmin" title="PHPMyAdmin" />  

Type in the credentials you have typed in earlier and you should be able to be
in the web frontend of your database.
