Hey everyone, this time we will cover a plugin called
[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree). This is the kind of
addition, which shows the file system with all it's files and sub folders. It
is a great tool to keep an overview, when working on a project or a big set of
files. Because I'm coming from a Sublime background, it was one of the first
things I've been missing. I was and am still one of those people, who interact
with the tree view quite a lot. I also prefer it over tabs and other
alternatives, but that is just my personal preference. With
[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) installed from the last
[post](http://snow-dev.com/the-power-of-vim-plugins-vundle/), it is pretty easy
to get started with NERDTree. Just add the following line to your plugin list
inside your _.vimrc_

```vim
Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree'
```

Re-source your _.vimrc_ and call _:PluginInstall_. Restart vim, just to be
save everything is properly set. Now call _:NERDTreeToggle_ and the tree view
should pop up on the left side of your vim instance.

NERDTree is just another split view, in which you aren't able to write
anything. It has it's own shortcuts, to which we come later. 

# Configuration
The first thing you probably think of, is why would I call _:NERDTreeToggle_
every time I start vim or open a new buffer. To end this struggle, just add the
following line into your _.vimrc_

```vim
autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree
```

There is one more thing I'm not comfortable with as well. And this is the
cursor being in NERDTree after startup. To position the cursor in the code file
to the right of NERDTree at the beginning, add the following line to the
_.vimrc_

```vim
autocmd VimEnter * wincmd p
```

If you are working with tabs on a regular basis, you will encounter, that
NERDTree isn't opened in new tabs as well. To mirror our existing NERDTree to
other tabs, we need an additional command in our _.vimrc_

```
autocmd BufWinEnter * NERDTreeMirror
```

An alternative approach is the
[NERDTree-Tabs](https://github.com/jistr/vim-nerdtree-tabs) plugin, which
enables this feature by default, without any configuration effort. The last
thing I have configured is a shortcut to focus NERDTree. Because I'm working
with split views pretty much at the moment, it is very inconvenient to walk
through all the views, until I'm back into NERDTree.

```vim
map <F5> :NERDTreeFocus<CR>
```

This maps the control key __F5__ to the NERDTree focus action. If you prefer
another key or a combination you are free to use whatever you are comfortable
with.

# Usage
With the last part of the configuration, we already stepped into the usage.
But what are we able to do, if we called _:NERDTreeFocus_? The short answer
is: pretty much everything you can do with a tree view in Sublime and
other editors/IDEs. In this tutorial I only go through the functions I use
mostly, but there are plenty more helpful shortcuts and functionalities. For a
full reference you can always type in ? while in NERDTree and you get the full
list of shortcuts. Press ? again to come back to the tree view.  # Navigation
Ok, lets start of easy. __j__ and __k__ are also used for navigating up and
down like in any other buffer. To jump to the parent directory, you can
press __p__ and if you want to go to your root directory you press __P__. To
open a directory press __o__. This will show all files and sub directories. To
close the directory, simply press __o__ again.  # Setting the current node and
bookmark The number one reason we want to use NERDTree is an overview of our
current project or set of files, which is always a sub node in our file system.
At the moment I'm navigating through the console to the root directory of my
project and open vim there. But there is also a NERDTree way of doing this. You
navigate to the root directory of your project in NERDTRee and press __cd__
afterwards. This means "change directory" and it doesn't have any visual
effect. But now every command you type into command-line mode is relative to
your chosen root directory and not to the system root. Next thing you may want
to do is to only show this directory and hide the rest of your file system. By
pressing __C__ you set the underlying directory as the top most visible node.
Every time you want to work on your project you need to navigate there. This
gets very exhaustive, but NERDTree has a neat feature called bookmarks. You can
bookmark directories and files and you are instantly able to open them from a
bookmarks list, without navigating there first. To bookmark a node, like our
project root, we type in _:Bookmark_, while NERDTree is focused and the project
root is chosen. To open our bookmarks we can press __B__ and now we can
type __cd__, __C__ and __o__ on the chosen bookmark and we are in our project
without navigating there first.

If you want to get rid of the bookmark, you just navigate to the bookmark
and press __D__.  

# Opening files
Now we come to the most important part, actually opening a file. There are
many different ways of opening. A normal open in the buffer to the right
is done by pressing __o__. But you are also able to open a file in a new
tab\[__t__\], in a vertical split\[__s__\] or horizontal split\[__i__\]. As a
site node: __o__ is always overwriting the buffer you were in last. So for
example, if you opened some vertical splits and you are in the most right
split, you focus NERDTree and open another file by pressing __o__, the most
right buffer will be overwritten. 

# Modifying nodes in the file system
In the beginning I just used terminal commands like _touch/mkdir/mv_. With the
help of __:!__ I was able to do any CLI command from within vim. Afterwards I
needed to refresh the file system by pressing __R__. But I discovered a much
easier way of doing things like these, quite recently. Just go to a node, which
you want to modify and press __m__. Now you get an overview of allowed
operations.

These are adding, moving/renaming, copying and removing files or directories.
Just choose the shortcut in front of the option and you will be put to the next
instruction buffer. Removing needs to be confirmed by a 'yes'. Adding, moving
and copying requires the new path. As an example: if you want to add a new
directory you press __m__ on the given node, followed by __a__ and then type in
a directory name, followed by a __/__, otherwise a file would be created. If
you are ok with the name, you confirm by pressing __Enter__. Every modification
done from this menu will update your tree view automatically, so there is no
need to refresh manually. I hope, this overview will get you started with
NERDTree properly. If you have any questions you can ask them in the comment
section below.
