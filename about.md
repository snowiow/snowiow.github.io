Hi, my name is Marcel Patzwahl and this is my personal blog. Here I'm writing
about any technical topic I'm currently interested in. Most of the time this is
is programming, DevOps, Linux, Vim or other terminal applications.

I hope you have as much fun reading as I have writing and working out the
different topics. I always try to write long in depth articles, which can be
followed as a step by step tutorial, but if you have any questions or requests,
please write me an [email](mailto:marcel.patzwahl@posteo.de). I will always try
to answer as fast as possible.
